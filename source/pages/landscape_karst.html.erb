    <p>A karst landscape is created by chemical reactions between the rock and acids present in the water.
      Most of these acids are found naturally in rain, ground water, and snow.
      These acids are capable of dissolving into weaker rocks such as limestone or dolostone.
      This results in the formation of caverns and sinkholes.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>	The most common type of rock for a karst landscape to occur on in is limestone, but has been known
          to occur on other types of rock such as gypsum and salt.
        The landscape frequently consists of sinkholes and underground water flows which can flow for miles.
	      The sinkholes present in a karst landscape pose a significant risk to property in the area.
        Additionally because a karst environment depends upon runoff from the environment
          it is possible for the ground water to become contaminated as a result of pollutants on the surface.
