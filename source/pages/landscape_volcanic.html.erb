      A volcanic landscape as the name implies is formed as a result of volcanic activities in the area. This does not necessarily imply that there is an actual volcano in the area rather there is merely tectonic activity, which results in the flow of
      lava. The result of these are lava tubes and volcanoes.</p>

    <h3>Lava Tubes</h3>

      Lava tubes form when small sections of lava flow develop a roof and as a result will flow through in a manner similar to pipes. This frequently occurs during pahoehoe eruptions. In the case of pahoehoe eruptions it is actually a lava flow which is
      different from the traditional volcanic eruptions we come to think about.

      There are numerous types of volcanoes such as: shield, cinder cone, lava dome, and composite. Shield volcanoes are like what you would see in Hawaii where there is gentle slope is created due to fast moving lava. Cinder cone volcanoes have a steep
      slope because the lava erupts into the air in a short distance from the top of the volcano. Lava dome volcanoes are frequently created after an explosive eruption when lava continues to flow out afterwards. Composite volcanoes are the volcanoes you
      typically think about where they explode violently; Mt. St. Helens was one of these volcanoes.</p>
